# Deployment Fix - Notification System

## 🐛 Issue Found

The deployment was failing due to a **missing backslash** in the Exception class reference.

### Error Location:
`app/Services/FirestoreService.php` line 306

**Before (BROKEN):**
```php
} catch (Exception $e) {
```

**After (FIXED):**
```php
} catch (\Exception $e) {
```

## ✅ What Was Fixed

1. **FirestoreService.php**: Added `\` before `Exception` to use the global Exception class
2. This was causing a fatal error during deployment because PHP couldn't find the `Exception` class

## 🚀 Deploy the Fix

```bash
cd healthreach-api
git add -A
git commit -m "Fix: Add backslash to Exception class in FirestoreService"
git push
```

Render will automatically redeploy with the fix.

## 🔍 Why It Failed

PHP namespaces require either:
- `use Exception;` at the top of the file, OR
- `\Exception` when catching exceptions

Without either, PHP looks for `App\Services\Exception` which doesn't exist.

## ✅ Changes That Are Now Safe to Deploy

1. **FirestoreService.php**:
   - ✅ Enhanced `getUser()` to search by firebase_uid
   - ✅ Fixed Exception handling

2. **WebHealthWorkerController.php**:
   - ✅ Unique notification IDs
   - ✅ Patient name handling
   - ✅ Individual patient selection

3. **notifications.blade.php**:
   - ✅ Better patient display
   - ✅ Full name support

## 🎯 After Deployment

Test the notification system:
1. Login as health worker
2. Go to Send Alerts
3. Select "Specific Patient"
4. Patient names should display correctly
5. Send notification - should work without "Patient not found" error

## 📊 Monitoring

Check logs after deployment:
```
https://healthreach-api.onrender.com/api/test/view-logs
```

Look for:
- ✅ "User found by firebase_uid"
- ✅ "Patient verified"
- ✅ "Recipients array: count: 1"
